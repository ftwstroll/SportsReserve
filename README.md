SportsReserve
------------------------------
This is an app intended to be a middle man between sports venues and players. A player may log in and browse arenas, then reserve a time slot for them to play there.

Getting Started
------------------------------
There are 2 files in github. They are zip files since the poject was comprised of far to many files. The project was also split into to zip files because of a 25mb constraint from github for each file. 


Installing
-----------------------------
The main zip file is titled after the project, SportsReserve. Unzip that one first. The second zip file contains a folder titles "app". The "app" folder will go in the "SportsReserve" folder. When that is complete, open up the project with Android studio. When opening a project with Android Studio, select the SportsReserve folder. 

Once open, do a "clean project". When that is complete press the green arrow or select "Run App". 
Follow prompts on selecting emulator. (Nexus 5X API 28 - PIE Android 9.0 was used in demo)
